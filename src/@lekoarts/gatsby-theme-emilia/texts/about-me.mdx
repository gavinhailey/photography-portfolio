## About Me

Hi, I am a Computer Science student at the University of Denver and Software Engineer at Ibotta. 

I do a bit of photography in my spare time, so this serves as a showcase of that.

If you are interested in any of my software development work you can view my [portfolio](https://gavinhailey.dev) here.
